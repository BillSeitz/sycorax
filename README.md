Sycorax
=======

Sycorax is a Twitter client, written in Python, that choreographs the
online behavior of fictional characters. Other tweet schedulers make
your personal Twitter stream look like a clockwork robot is behind it,
posting tweets at the optimal time for penetration into your social
network. Syxorax lets fictional characters use Twitter the way real
people do. Your characters can post at odd hours and talk to each
other, taking their lines from a simple script you write, but without
any ongoing work from you.

For detailed instructions on scripting characters, see the project
